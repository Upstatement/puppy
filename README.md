## ü§ùContributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!

Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/upstatement/puppy-starter/issues).

### Testing

This project includes lightweight test coverage to ensure that dependency updates don't break anything. It uses the [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner, with tests executed on every PR using [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/).

To run the tests locally:

```sh
npm test
```

Tests utilize [snapshot testing](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/04-snapshot-testing.md) to ensure that generated files don't change in unexpected ways.

If you're making updates to the starter template and _are_ expecting changes to generated files, you can run `npm test -- -u` to update test snapshots.

### Dependabot

Node dependencies are managed automatically using [Depandabot](https://dependabot.com/).

It will submit a PR to the repo updating dependencies whenever updates within the specified version constraints are available.
