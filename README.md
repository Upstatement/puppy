## ‚ú® Install

```

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage

### Development

```sh
# Start a local dev server
npm start

# Check for JS/SCSS style violations prior to commit
npm run lint

# Fix the fixable linter violations
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### Production

```sh
# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve locally using `serve`
npx serve dist
```

#### Thumbnail Previews

By default, `npm run build` will capture screenshots of all pages for use as thumbnail previews in the prototype index.

You can provide your own thumbnails by dropping an image in the `public/thumbnails` directory and referencing its path in your page's front matter header:

**Page**: src/pages/example.html

**Thumbnail**: public/screenshots/example.png

**Front Matter**:

```yml
thumbnail: example.png
```

You can also disable screenshots entirely by adding `DISABLE_SCREENSHOTS=true` to the build script in `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production DISABLE_SCREENSHOTS=true gulp build",
  }
```

### Deployment

The output of `npm run build` is a static site. You can drop the resulting `dist` directory on any web server.

An excellent choice is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

You can deploy your work to Netlify with their [CLI tool](https://github.com/netlify/cli).

```
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify init
netlify deploy
```
