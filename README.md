## 👩‍💻 Usage

### Development

npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

### Deployment

The output of `npm run build` is a static site. You can drop the resulting `dist` directory on any web server.

An excellent choice is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

You can deploy your work to Netlify with their [CLI tool](https://github.com/netlify/cli).

```
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify init
netlify deploy
